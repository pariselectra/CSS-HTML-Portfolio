        <section class="about-me-format">
            <p>The one consistent theme throughout my career has been perseverance. After receiving a degree
            from the University of Texas at Austin for International Relations and Global Studies and a
            minor in business, I started my own business. Following a successful few years operating in 
            the entertainment/nightlife industry, 2020 presented an opportunity to pivot my expertise. With 
            the furniture industry on the rise after the pandemic, I was offered a position at Mattress
            Firm. After less than one year with the company, I was offered a promotion. Not only was I 
            one of the only women in management, but I was also the youngest manager on staff at the
            time. My first year as a manager, I exceeded all sales expectations and put my division in 
            the black for the first time in years. Although this was an exciting moment in my career with
            the company, I decided I was ready for a new challenge. I quit my job after receiving the Million
            Dollar Writer award and attended a coding bootcamp with the University of Texas at Austin. This 
            portfolio serves as a testiment to my coding abilities and love for software engineering. Although
            my background might cover a few different industries, the one consistent theme is my perseverance.
