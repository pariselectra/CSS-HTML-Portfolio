# Challenge-2

## Description
This was the second challenge of my coding bootcamp. The task was to create a portfolio website from scratch in order to demonstrate proficiency in HTML and CSS.  The completion criteria was relatively broad. The main goal was to master flex-box, picture spacing, and internal/external link integration.

Prior to this project, my interaction with CSS and HTML had been strictly through classroom style learning. This was the first project I built truly from scratch. As I continue to grow and add skills to my repertoire, I hope that this project will serve as a benchmark for my first usage of HTML/CSS. I purposefully went well above the scope and requirements for the project in order to stretch and practice my skills as a developer as well as a designer. Within the portfolio website, there is extra attention to detail in the color scheme. The profile photo is cropped and moves dynamically with the page for aesthetic purposes. Additionally, the photo links in the contact me section required quite a bit more code than traditional HTML hyperlinks.

This portfolio itself is dynamic and is made to be updated as I add projects and challenges to my repositories. Some CSS features that make the portfolio notable are:
	
    -interactive navigation bar

	-in-line, responsive profile picture

	-responsive and interactive line of projects

	-contact me links to external pages

Mastering spacing and dynamic response can be tricky in CSS, but overall, through trial and error, I learned how to effectively lay-out an interactive web page.
